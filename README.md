# React Native Boilerplate

This repository serves as a robust boilerplate for starting new React Native projects. It includes pre-configured tools, libraries, and best practices to help developers jumpstart their applications with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Navigation**: Integrated with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized folder structure for components, screens, assets, and utilities.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ready-to-use TypeScript configuration for type-safe development.
- **Utilities**: Includes helper functions and utilities to accelerate development.

- **State Management**: Includes setup for [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and Context API for managing global state.(Uncoming Feature!)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x) or yarn
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio / Xcode (for native builds)
